    "# Worldle Solver\n",
    "First stab at this. Strategy: Decision tree with score = \"average depth (number of turns) needed to get to correct solution\". Will need to make some choices for how to pare that tree down ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Second Stab: Construct it as a game, with \"Hero\" (the human player) and \"Villain\" (the wordle), acting as something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Game:\n",
    "Villain.choose_word()\n",
    "while turn < max_turns:\n",
    "    turn += 1\n",
    "    guess = Hero.play()\n",
    "    score = Villain.evaluate(guess)\n",
    "    if score == 'win':\n",
    "        return f\"victory in {turn} turns!\"\n",
    "    Hero.update(score)\n",
    "if == max_turns: \n",
    "    return f\"Hero loses, failed to guess {Villain.solution}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Second framework is better and more versatile because it allows me implement several different strategies as separate \"agents\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Third version: similar to second -- see `WordleGameUpdate`. Not sure yet if that's an improvement ... kinda just going in circles."
